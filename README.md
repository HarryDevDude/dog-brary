Group name:
Using the group memeber's first initials of our names we came up with "AHKSMY" like ACME from Looney Tunes.

Project description:
We created an app that helps users find information on dog breeds with fast and concise information.

Project specs:
We used functional components using the create-react-app. 
The project has 2 components with props and state. 2 query parameters.
And Axios and Bootstrap for styling rending a form for user to input a dog breed.
The once the user enters in the a dog breed Dog-brary will render:

The name of the dog
Bred for
Life Span
Height in metric values
Weight in metric values
Image of the dog. If no image is rendered it an alt description of the name of the dog will be in it's place.
